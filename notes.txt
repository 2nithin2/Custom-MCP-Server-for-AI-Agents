1. There are over 260 known species of monkeys, divided into two major groups: Old World monkeys (found in Africa and Asia) and New World monkeys (found in Central and South America).
2. Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset (around 5 inches long and weighing about 4 ounces) to the mandrill (up to 3 feet long and weighing up to 77 pounds).
3. Unlike apes, most monkey species have tails. New World monkeys often have prehensile tails that can grip branches like an extra limb.
4. Monkeys are highly intelligent animals with complex social structures. Many species live in troops with strict hierarchies and sophisticated communication systems.
5. The diet of monkeys varies by species but generally includes fruits, nuts, leaves, insects, and small vertebrates. Some species are primarily frugivores (fruit-eaters) while others are more omnivorous.
6. Monkeys have opposable thumbs, which allow them to grasp objects with precision. New World monkeys often have pseudo-opposable thumbs and some have opposable big toes as well.
7. Many monkey species are endangered due to habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal pet trade. The cotton-top tamarin, Roloway monkey, and Tonkin snub-nosed monkey are among the most critically endangered.
8. The average lifespan of monkeys varies widely by species, ranging from about 10 years for smaller species to over 30 years for larger species in the wild, and even longer in captivity.
9. Japanese macaques, also known as snow monkeys, are famous for bathing in hot springs to stay warm during winter—a learned behavior that has been passed down through generations.
10. Capuchin monkeys are among the most intelligent monkey species and have been observed using tools in the wild, such as using stones to crack nuts and dig for food.
